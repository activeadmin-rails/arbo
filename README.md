This is a fork of the original Arbre project starting when I stepped down from maintaining Active Admin in 2018.

# Arbre - HTML Views in Ruby

[Arbre](https://www.activeadmin.info/arbre) makes it easy to generate HTML directly in Ruby. This gem was extracted from [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/active_admin).

## Goals

The purpose of Arbre is to leave the view as ruby objects as long
as possible. This allows OO Design to be used to implement the view layer.

## Getting started
