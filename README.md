# Arbo - HTML Views in Ruby

[Arbo](https://github.com/varyonic/arbo) makes it easy to generate HTML directly in Ruby. This gem was forked from [Arbre](https://github.com/activeadmin/arbre),
starting when the author stepped down from maintaining Active Admin in 2018.
Google 'why fork open source' for relevant articles.
